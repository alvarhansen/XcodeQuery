# M9-01 — Phase 4: Docs & Release Notes (Swift Packages)

Goal: Ship user-facing documentation and update release notes.

## Tasks

- Readme
  - Add a new Examples section for packages with 3–4 sample queries.
- Release notes
  - Under Unreleased, add a bullet list of new root/target fields and enums.
- Schema rendering
  - Ensure `xcq schema` includes the new fields under Top-level fields and Types.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Readme reflects the new queries and matches the actual schema names.
- Release notes drafted and ready to include on next tag.
