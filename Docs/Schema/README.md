# XcodeQuery GraphQL Schema

This folder documents the current GraphQL-style query surface that the CLI exposes. It captures the baseline contract used for the GraphQLSwift migration (Phase 0 â€” Baseline Fidelity Freeze).

- See `Baseline.md` for the frozen schema summary, argument defaults, and behavioral notes (errors, quirks).
- Snapshots that lock representative results live under `Tests/XcodeQueryKitTests/Snapshots/GraphQLBaseline/` and are exercised by tests.
